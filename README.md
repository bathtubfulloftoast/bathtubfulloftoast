im alice/nova i develop things
my main project is [my site](https://novassite) which is semi-closed source due to the fact its selfhosted and has hardcoded api keys.
however if you see any code you want ill hand it over.
i mainly work in php html and css for the time being, however im trying to figure out nodejs and python.
